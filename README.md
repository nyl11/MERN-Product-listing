## About

This Product Listing Webpage is a modern, responsive React application designed to showcase products dynamically. It allows users to browse, search, filter, and sort products while providing a smooth shopping experience with an integrated cart. The app supports light and dark themes, infinite scrolling for seamless browsing, and real-time cart updates. 

Product data is fetched from a publicly available dummy API, allowing the application to display realistic product information such as images, categories, prices, ratings, and discounts without requiring a backend setup. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, it demonstrates best practices for state management using Context API and custom hooks (`useProducts`), making it easy to extend or integrate with a real backend API in the future.
